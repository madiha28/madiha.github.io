<h1>Madiha Hussain</h1>

<p>I work at the intersection of machine learning, statistics and data infrastructure. I am currently at Ellison Institiute of Transformative Medicine, where I am writing large scale infrastructure to reconstruct 3D structure of tissue and studying how 3D improves cancer classification algorithms traditionally applied in 2D.
<p>Previously I was at Fem Inc. where I focussed on automated classification and metadata enrichment of short form video content. I also designed and deployed models to improve user engagement in video content.

<li>Predictive Modelling
<ul>
<li>Implement model to extract users with strong TV viewing habits. Predict channel and show preferences of such users and ensure very high precision in the predictions. 
<li>Train models to predict video engagement metrics using features extracted from video metadata; improved click and completion rates by 25% to 50% on a number of partners.
<li>Improve the performance of models used for inferring video categories and motivation by 30% by extracting  additional features and testing additional algorithms.
<li>Spearhead efforts to implement different components of machine learning pipeline (data collection, feature extraction, cross‐validation) independently to enable rigorous feature engineering and model selection, easy updates to the model, and to improve reusability.
<li>Design and implemented microservice‐oriented infrastructure to deploy models, decouple implementation details of models from the projects utilizing them,  minimize memory use, and obtain rapid real‐time predictions.
